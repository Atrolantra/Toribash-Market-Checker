Support for items in sets or for checking only items within specific sets.

Only showing output for items that are currently above or bellow their ideal price for competitive proft.

Ordering of output by price or one of the five classifications. 

Ideally the /ingame_store.php?json page would contain info about all items. Unfortunately it doesn't have some in there. Fortunately the same info needed for the code here can be grtabbed from an item listing if it's already on the market. At the moment that is the backup checking method if the first fails. Needs to be changed so that it is the only method and gets the data based off of the item the user is checking since those items are always in the market (but excluded from price comparisons).
