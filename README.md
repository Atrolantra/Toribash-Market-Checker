Python version 2.7.10

This is some code I put together to allow users from the Toribash game/forum to calculate the highest competitive value of their (or other users') market inventory.

Will need python to run. Then just follow directions in the terminal by entering username, pass and username of user to check. After running a datestamped file will be created in the same folder/level as the python file for your perusal.
